# Quadratic-equation-solver
A script that calculates the roots of equation $ax^2 + bx + c$.

The script asks from the user to give three numbers. Then it computes the discriminant Δ = $b^2 - 4ac$. 

There are three cases:

- If Δ > 0 then the equation has two real solutions: x1, x2 = $-b \pm \ sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
